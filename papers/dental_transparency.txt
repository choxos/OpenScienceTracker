Abstract
We assessed adherence to five transparency practices—data sharing, code sharing, conflict of interest disclosure, funding disclosure, and protocol registration—in
articles in dental journals. We searched and exported the full text of all research articles from PubMed-indexed dental journals available in the Europe PubMed Central
database until the end of 2021. We programmatically assessed their adherence to the
five transparency practices using a validated and automated tool. Journal- and articlerelated information was retrieved from ScimagoJR and Journal Citation Reports. Of
all 329,784 articles published in PubMed-indexed dental journals, 10,659 (3.2%)
were available to download. Of those, 77% included a conflict of interest disclosure,
and 62% included a funding disclosure. Seven percent of the articles had a registered
protocol. Data sharing (2.0%) and code sharing (0.1%) were rarer. Sixteen percent
of articles did not adhere to any of the five transparency practices, 29% adhered to
one, 48% adhered to two, 7.0% adhered to three, 0.3% adhered to four, and no article
adhered to all five practices. Adherence to transparency practices increased over time;
however, data and code sharing especially remained rare. Coordinated efforts involving all stakeholders are needed to change current transparency practices in dental
research.

INTRODUCTION
Open registration of protocols and their amendments, and
access to data and the study report, are essential components of open science. When conducting and reporting
research, transparency is essential for detecting or preventing
research bias and also for assessing the credibility of scientific
findings. The importance of research transparency for the

proper evaluation of research findings using big data or
involving artificial intelligence algorithms has also been
emphasized [1]. In addition, some of these transparency
practices include disclosure of funding, disclosure of conflicts of interest (COI), detailed reporting of methods that
allow result replications, and publication of original data
and code to ensure reproducibility and full use of the data
[2–4].

A recent systematic review of almost 3 million biomedical
studies showed major improvements in COI and funding
disclosures but only minor improvements in protocol registration, data sharing, and code sharing since 2000 [4]. Smaller
and less-comprehensive studies have investigated transparency practices in dental research [5, 6]. They have shown
far-from-optimal practices in funding and COI disclosures,
protocol registration, and data sharing, which have been
reported in a recent scoping review [5]. However, methodological differences and inconsistencies in definitions and
reporting in primary studies did not allow the authors of that
review [5] to obtain a comprehensive view of transparency
practices in dental research. Consistent with the findings from
the research articles, investigations of journal policies in dental journals have shown suboptimal adherence to transparency
practices, for instance, by not requiring preregistration of
trials [7, 8].
Monitoring transparency has been seen as an essential way
to increase value and reduce waste in biomedical research
[9] and should be of great interest to research funders [10,
11]. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports of
transparency indexes in the dental literature. For this, we
assessed the adherence to five transparency practices—data
sharing, code sharing, COI disclosure, funding disclosure, and
statements of protocol registration—in open access full-text
articles published in dental journals available from the Europe
PubMed Central (EPMC) database. We mapped transparency
practices across publication years and according to journal
and article-related characteristics.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
The protocol for this descriptive study is available on the Open
Science Framework (OSF) (osf.io/h5p6a). All codes and data
related to this study were shared via its OSF repository
(osf.io/4eq8u) at the time of manuscript submission.

Data sources and study selection
We searched for open-access articles from dental journals
available in the EPMC open science database. We reviewed
dental journals based on a list of PubMed-indexed dental
journals provided by the National Library of Medicine catalogue (bit.ly/37XwnMt). We restricted our search to papers in
English, and considered papers published until 31 December
2021, without a lower limit.
The search query for the EPMC database was as follows: ‘(ISSNs for all dental journals) AND (SRC:“MED”)
AND (LANG:“eng” OR LANG:“en” OR LANG:“us”)
AND (FIRST_PDATE:1900-01-01 TO 2021-12-31) AND
(OPEN_ACCESS:y) AND (PUB_TYPE:“Journal Article”

RAITTIO ET AL.

OR PUB_TYPE:“research-article” OR PUB_TYPE:“rapidcommunication” OR PUB_TYPE:“product-review”)’.
We downloaded all identified available records in XML
full-text format for full-text evaluation using the metareader
package [12], and the proportion of articles available as open
access via the EPMC was calculated based on the total number
of articles detected in the database.

Data extraction and synthesis
We assessed adherence of articles to five transparency
practices—COI disclosure, funding disclosure, protocol registration, data sharing, and code sharing—using a validated
and automated tool (rtransparent package) developed by
Serghiou et al. [4] to identify these five transparency practices
programmatically (in an automated way). This tool identifies the five transparency practices based on phrases and their
location in the article (e.g., the Acknowledgements section).
For data sharing, code sharing, and protocol registration, the
tool identifies whether the article had actually adhered to practice (for instance, the statement “data available on request” is
not counted as sharing data), whereas COI and funding disclosure merely detect whether articles include the disclosure,
regardless of its specific content [4]. For instance, COI disclosures are detected by identification of: (a) common phrases,
such as “conflicts of interest” or “competing interests”; (b)
common titles of sections with a COI disclosure (e.g., “Conflicts of Interests”); (c) common phrases in COI disclosures
(e.g., “XX received commercial benefits from YY” or “No
competing interests”); and/or (d) an acknowledgment section
containing words or phrases common in COI disclosures (e.g.,
“fees”, “advisory board”, etc.). More information about the
tool and its validation is described elsewhere [4].
For validation of the transparency practices identified in the
sample articles, we manually checked the presence/absence
of data sharing, code sharing, COI disclosure, funding disclosure, and protocol registration in 50 random articles from the
sample using methods described by Serghiou et al. [4].
Basic journal- and article-related information (publication
year, citations of article, and journal name) was retrieved from
the EPMC database. Publisher information was extracted
from ScimagoJR (scimagojr.com), and journal impact factor (JIF) was obtained from the Journal Citation Reports
(jcr.clarivate.com).
As indicated by earlier studies [4] and our preliminary
investigations of this sample, information obtained from the
EPMC database (from PubMed) on article type was inaccurate. Based on earlier literature [13], an algorithm was
developed to classify the different types of studies using information from titles and abstracts. The algorithm was optimized
in several rounds of tests and validation samples. In a final
validation sample of 100 articles, the algorithm produced

78% agreement with manual categorization based on title and
abstract (more information and code is available in the Supplementary Material of the OSF repository [osf.io/4eq8u]),
which the authors deemed sufficient and provided guiding
article-type categorization.

Data analysis
We used R v4.1.2 [14] for searches, data handling, analysis, and reporting. The searches and data export from EPMC
were conducted using the europepmc package [15]. Indicators
of transparency practices from the available full texts were
extracted using the rtransparent package. Trends over time
in transparency practices were reported in descriptive tabulations and graphical illustrations that were created using the
ggplot2 package [16]. As this type of programmatical (automated) detection is not perfect, we used the sensitivity and
specificity of the rtransparent package [4] to generate 95%
CIs for the prevalence estimates of the transparency practices
we obtained using the epiR package [17]. We also calculated
the number of transparency practices adhered to in articles,
with that count ranging from 0 to 5 practices. We used the
Wilcoxon rank-sum test to test the statistical significance
of the relationship between transparency indicators and JIF
or received citations. Fisher’s exact test with Monte Carlosimulated p-values for differences in transparency practices
according to publication year, journals, and publishers were
performed. Detailed information, deviations from protocol,
data, and code are available as Supplementary Material on the
OSF repository (osf.io/4eq8u).

RESULTS
The total number of articles (open access and non-open
access) was 329,784; the full texts of 10,659 (3.2%) were
accessible via the EPMC (open access), and, of those, only
three were published before 2000, while 1872 (17.6%) were
published in 2021 (Figure S1).
The retrieved articles were published in a total of 78 dental
journals. When stratified according to article frequency, the
five dental journals with the largest number of articles were
BMC Oral Health (n = 2503), Journal of Applied Oral Science (n = 1440), Medicina Oral, Patología Oral y Cirugía
Bucal (n = 1174), Head & Face Medicine (n = 572), and
Dental Press Journal of Orthodontics (n = 530). The mean
and median number of citations of these articles were 5.7 (SD
= 15.0) and 2 (IQR = 7), respectively. The most cited article,
with 812 citations, was published in the International Journal
of Oral Science [18].
More than three quarters (76.7%, 95% CI: 75.9–77.5; n =
8173) of the articles had a COI disclosure (Figure 1A). Fewer

than two-thirds (61.5%, 95% CI: 60.6–62.4; n = 6558) of
the articles had a funding disclosure. Seven percent (6.9%,
95% CI: 6.4–7.4; n = 737) of the articles had a registered
protocol. Two percent of articles (2.0%, 95% CI: 1.7–2.3;
n = 212) had shared their data. One in a thousand articles (0.1%, 95% CI: 0.04–0.2; n = 8) had shared their
code.
We observed an increase over time in the proportion of
articles with COI disclosure, funding disclosure, and protocol
registration, with the proportions highest in 2021 (Figure 1B).
One sixth (15.9%, n = 1697) of the articles did not adhere
to any of the five transparency practices, 28.6% (n = 3048)
adhered to one, 48.2% (n = 5134) adhered to two, and 7.0%
(n = 748) adhered to three. Less than 1% (0.3%, n = 32) of
the articles showed adherence to four transparency practices,
and none used all five.
Apart from code sharing, we observed journal- and
publisher-related differences in transparency practices
(Tables 1 and 2, and Supplementary Material at osf.io/4eq8u).
Articles in which transparency practices were adhered to
were published in journals that had a slightly higher median
JIF but fewer citations than those which did not adhere to
transparency practices (Table 3). Reviews and interventional
studies showed higher adherence to protocol registration
(Table 4). The lowest adherence to the five transparency
practices was found in articles other than reviews and
interventional, observational, and laboratory studies.
In the validation sample, one of the articles was an abstract
without any full text. Hence, our validation sample consisted
of 49 articles. Of these 49 articles, nine (3.6%) discrepancies
between automatic tool and manual checking were found: two
for open data, four for COI disclosure, one for funding disclosure, and two for registration (see Supplementary Material at
osf.io/4eq8u).

DISCUSSION
Our investigation showed major improvements in COI
disclosure, funding disclosure, protocol registration, and data
sharing in dental research since 2000. However, still, in 2021,
there were major deficiencies, particularly in protocol registration and sharing of data or codes—most articles adhered
to only one or two transparency practices. Differences
in JIF based on the adherence of articles to transparency
indicators were modest. Articles demonstrating adherence to
transparency practices had lower citation counts, which may
be related to publication more recently than those articles for
which adherence to transparency practices was not identified.
We also detected study type-, journal-, and publisher-related
differences in transparency practices.
Our findings were generally consistent with those of Pandis et al. [5], who reported that adherence to good scientific

TRANSPARENCY OF DENTAL RESEARCH

practices, such as the five transparency practices investigated
here, increased in dental research over time. However, we
found much higher adherence to COI disclosure (77%) than
Pandis et al. [5] (8%–39%). Otherwise, our findings on the
prevalence of funding disclosure, protocol registration, and
data sharing were in line with the rough estimates from small
and very heterogeneous primary studies [5]. For instance,
many of the primary studies were restricted to a few leading journals or to some subfield of dentistry [19–21]. To
our knowledge, code sharing has not been investigated in
detail in dental research before and, unfortunately, remains
rare. We also showed that rarely do dental articles adhere to
many transparency practices simultaneously. Thus, there were
deficiencies in some of the five aspects of transparency in
almost all articles. However, compared with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related dental research analyzed using
the same methods [22], our findings showed higher adherence
to all transparency practices. For instance, much higher adherence to COI disclosure was observed in all dental research
(86%–95%, Supplementary Material at osf.io/4eq8u) than in
COVID-19-related dental research (74%) during the period
2020–2021 [22].
A comparison with almost three million biomedical
research articles analyzed using the same automated tools as
the present study showed that COI disclosures were included
more often in dental research articles than in biomedical articles in 2020 [4]. There was no difference in the prevalence of
funding disclosure between dental and biomedical research
articles. However, data sharing (2.0%) and code sharing
(0.1%) were less common in dental articles than in biomedical
research articles (8.9% and 1.2%, respectively) [4]. Protocol
registration, conversely, was more common in the dental articles (6.9%) than in the biomedical research articles (2.6%) [4].
The proportion of dental articles available from the EPMC
(3.2%) is smaller than that of all biomedical (PubMed) articles
(24%, Supplementary Material at osf.io/4eq8u), and information is unavailable regarding whether these samples are
equally representative of all (open and non-open access)
dental and biomedical articles. However, it seems that the
proportion of open access dental articles increases considerably over time [23]. It is also possible that differences in
the research curriculum or journal styles could explain these
discrepancies, and this should be clarified in future studies.
Many authors and institutions have highlighted the benefits
of transparent science, namely to increase reliability, credibility, and reproducibility of science, and reduce research waste
[2, 24, 25]. All funders, publishers, societies, institutions,
editors, reviewers, and authors have the responsibility to
improve scientific practices, including transparency [2]. For
instance, stakeholders could radically increase the incentives
for implementing good scientific practices by using the
Registered Report publishing format, where peer-review for
publication and funding could be conducted simultaneously

RAITTIO ET AL.

in the design phase before data collection, in addition to
“normal” peer-review when reporting study findings [26,
27]. This would improve research transparency in light of
current open science and transparency standards in many
journals across fields [28–30]. Our positive findings of
increased inclusion of COI disclosure in recent years are
likely the result of long and determined efforts, indicating
that major developments in transparency are possible in
the long term [31]. However, registration of interventional
studies, such as randomized controlled trials, or systematic
reviews can be significantly improved [7, 32–34]. For
instance, stricter adherence to journal policies is needed
from authors but also from journals themselves [7]. On
the other hand, one can say that wider adherence to transparent practices would only modestly improve the current
state of science because no amount of transparency can
overcome the systematic bias stemming from publication
and impact-driven “publish or perish” science [35–37].
For instance, in addition to advancing preregistration and
sharing data and code, evidently more detailed, complete,
and comprehensible reporting of how research was carried
out is needed to improve the replicability and credibility of
research [3].
There are some limitations and features of our investigation
that have to be noted when interpreting our findings. One is
that we did not analyze the content or appropriateness of COI
or funding statements or protocol registration. Of concern,
earlier studies have implied that actually few dental studies
report any COI or sponsorship from for-profit sources [38]
and that most registered dental studies are registered retrospectively [7]. Second, the algorithms captured only free data
and code sharing, which is problematic if one has not used any
data or performed any statistical analyses (as there is no data
or code to share). It is also evident that not all research data
can be made readily available, for instance because of privacy
issues or requirements of data owners. Sometimes data are
made available on reasonable request from the authors. However, a recent study indicated problems related to sharing data
on reasonable request: only 7% of authors who declared that
they would share data on reasonable request actually did so
when their data were requested [39].
The study sample was restricted to open access articles in
the EPMC database and thus the sample may not represent
all research articles published in dental journals. However,
investigation of biomedical research articles has shown that,
in terms of these five transparency indicators, there are only
small differences between articles accessible and inaccessible
via the EPMC [40, 41]. On the other hand, there are some
notable differences between open access and non-open access
articles: open access articles are more frequently published
by men, people employed at prestigious institutions, those
with greater federal research funding, and those in more
advanced career stages [42]. It is also possible that despite our

attempts to exclude all non-research articles, some proportion
of articles had no data or code to share or no need to register
a protocol (such as commentaries). In addition, as our validation analyses showed, some articles included only abstracts
and lacked the information required for a complete evaluation.
However, the validation sample showed that the methods
applied are approriate for investigation of transparency in
dental research articles. Finally, one should note that because
we investigated only information in published research articles, we do not know whether relevant information has been
delivered during the submission and peer review process. It is
hoped that the absence of funding or COI statements in published articles is simply because of a decision not to publish
such information; for instance, as a result of journal style not
to publish funding statements if authors report they received
no external funding. Investigations of journal submission and
peer review policies, and adherence to them, would provide
valuable knowledge about what the dental journals demand
in terms of transparency and why some articles lack funding
disclosure, COI disclosure or protocol registration statements.
We showed that adherence to transparency practices in
studies published in dental journals available via the EPMC
has increased between 2000 and 2021, but data and code sharing remained rare, even in 2021. Coordinated efforts involving
all stakeholders are needed to provide further improvements
in the transparency of dental science.
