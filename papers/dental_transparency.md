# Research transparency in dental research: A programmatic analysis

**Authors:** Eero Raittio, Ahmad Sofi-Mahmudi, Sergio E. Uribe

## Abstract

We assessed adherence to five transparency practices—data sharing, code sharing, conflict of interest disclosure, funding disclosure, and protocol registration—in articles in dental journals. We searched and exported the full text of all research articles from PubMed-indexed dental journals available in the Europe PubMed Central database until the end of 2021. We programmatically assessed their adherence to the five transparency practices using a validated and automated tool. Journal- and article-related information was retrieved from ScimagoJR and Journal Citation Reports. Of all 329,784 articles published in PubMed-indexed dental journals, 10,659 (3.2%) were available to download. Of those, 77% included a conflict of interest disclosure, and 62% included a funding disclosure. Seven percent of the articles had a registered protocol. Data sharing (2.0%) and code sharing (0.1%) were rarer. Sixteen percent of articles did not adhere to any of the five transparency practices, 29% adhered to one, 48% adhered to two, 7.0% adhered to three, 0.3% adhered to four, and no article adhered to all five practices. Adherence to transparency practices increased over time; however, data and code sharing especially remained rare. Coordinated efforts involving all stakeholders are needed to change current transparency practices in dental research.

## Introduction

Open registration of protocols and their amendments, and access to data and the study report, are essential components of open science. When conducting and reporting research, transparency is essential for detecting or preventing research bias and also for assessing the credibility of scientific findings. The importance of research transparency for the proper evaluation of research findings using big data or involving artificial intelligence algorithms has also been emphasized.

## Methodology

This study used a programmatic analysis approach using the rtransparent package to assess transparency indicators across dental literature. The study analyzed articles from PubMed-indexed dental journals available in the Europe PubMed Central database.

### Transparency Indicators Assessed:
1. **Data sharing** - Availability of research data
2. **Code sharing** - Availability of analysis code
3. **Conflict of interest disclosure** - COI statements
4. **Funding disclosure** - Funding source information
5. **Protocol registration** - Registered study protocols

## Key Findings

- Of 329,784 articles in dental journals, only 10,659 (3.2%) were available as open access
- 77% included conflict of interest disclosure
- 62% included funding disclosure  
- 7% had registered protocols
- Only 2.0% shared data
- Only 0.1% shared code
- No article adhered to all five transparency practices
- Transparency practices showed improvement over time but remained low for data/code sharing
