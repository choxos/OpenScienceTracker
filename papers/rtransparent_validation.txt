Abstract
Recent concerns about the reproducibility of science have led to several calls for more open
and transparent research practices and for the monitoring of potential improvements over
time. However, with tens of thousands of new biomedical articles published per week, manually mapping and monitoring changes in transparency is unrealistic. We present an opensource, automated approach to identify 5 indicators of transparency (data sharing, code
sharing, conflicts of interest disclosures, funding disclosures, and protocol registration) and
apply it across the entire open access biomedical literature of 2.75 million articles on
PubMed Central (PMC). Our results indicate remarkable improvements in some (e.g., conflict of interest [COI] disclosures and funding disclosures), but not other (e.g., protocol registration and code sharing) areas of transparency over time, and map transparency across
fields of science, countries, journals, and publishers. This work has enabled the creation of
a large, integrated, and openly available database to expedite further efforts to monitor,
understand, and promote transparency and reproducibility in science.

Introduction
Research reproducibility [1] is a fundamental tenet of science, yet recent reports suggest that
reproducibility of published findings should not be taken for granted [2]. Both theoretical
expectations [3] and empirical evidence [4–8] suggest that most published results may be
either non-reproducible or inflated. Cardinal among recommendations for more credible and
efficient scientific investigation [9–18] is the need for transparent, or open science [16,19].
Such transparent practice, among others, facilitates reproducibility by providing the data and

Indicators of transparency across 2.75 million open access articles on PubMed Central

code required to rerun reported analyses and promotes replicability by providing a detailed
account of the methods and protocols employed.
In 2014, a team of experts outlined a number of recommended indicators of transparency
that may be monitored by interested stakeholders to assess and promote improvements in biomedical research [20]. Our group previously evaluated 441 randomly selected biomedical articles from 2000 to 2014 [21], illustrating that across several of these indicators [21], only 136
(30.8%) articles had a conflict of interest (COI) disclosure (about the presence or absence of
COI), and 213 (48.3%) had a funding disclosure (about presence or absence of funding); no
article made its data or code openly available. A follow-up study of 149 articles published
between 2015 and 2017 noted substantial improvements over time, with 97 (65.1%) sharing a
COI disclosure, 103 (69.1%) sharing a funding disclosure, and 19 (12.8%) sharing at least some
of their data; still, no code sharing was identified [22]. While our previous studies suggest low,
but slowly improving levels of transparency and reproducibility, they are limited in that they
only capture a small random subset of the biomedical literature and require laborious manual
screening and data abstraction. A larger, high-throughput evaluation would be necessary to
keep up to date with the pace of expanding literature and understand the distribution of transparency across more granular categories, such as time or fields of science.
Currently available tools can identify certain indicators of transparency, but they cannot be
used to map and monitor these indicators across the published biomedical literature, their
code is not openly available, their true performance is unknown, or they are paid services [23–
26]. A recent publication utilized methods of machine learning to identify, among others, conflicts of interest and funding disclosures, but it can only process acknowledgments [27].
Another recently published tool, called SciScore, uses a machine learning method known as
conditional random fields to identify measures of rigor (e.g., randomization, blinding, and
power analysis) across the open access literature on PubMed and create a score of rigor and
transparency. However, this tool does not include indicators of transparency (e.g., data or
code sharing), did not provide article-specific data, and the underlying code was not made
openly available [28].
Our work aims to expand our assessment of multiple indicators of transparency across the
entire open biomedical literature. We hereby develop, validate, and utilize a new set of rulebased tools to assess Data sharing, Code sharing, COI disclosures, Funding disclosures, and
open Protocol registration across the entire open access literature on PubMed. By doing so, we
are able to map all of these indicators across publishers, journals, countries, and disciplines.
Finally, we make our tools and data openly available, such that these may serve as a unifying
foundation upon which future work will build and expand.

Results
Manual assessment of transparency and reproducibility across 499 PubMed
articles (2015 to 2018)
We started with a manual assessment of a random sample of 499 English language articles
from PubMed published in recent years (2015 to 2018) (Table 1). COI disclosures and Funding
disclosures were assessed in all 499 articles, whereas all other indicators of transparency and
reproducibility were only assessed in the more relevant subset of 349 articles with empirical
data (henceforth referred to as “research articles”). This work expands on a previous in-depth
assessment of a random sample of PubMed articles [22], as more recent literature is deemed
likely to have the highest rates of transparency and yield additional data for training automated
algorithms focusing on current practices.

Out of all 499 articles, 341 (68%) had a COI disclosure, and 352 (71%) had a Funding disclosure. Of 349 research articles, 68 (20%) had a Data sharing statement, 5 (1%) had a Code
sharing statement, 246 (71%) had a COI disclosure, 284 (81%) had a Funding disclosure, 22
(6%) had an openly registered Protocol, 175 (50%) made a statement of Novelty (e.g., “report
for the first time”), and 33 (10%) included a Replication component in their research (e.g., validating previously published experiments, running a similar clinical trial in a different population, etc.) (Fig 1A). Most articles with transparency statements or disclosures claimed no COIs
(89% [218/246] of research articles with COI disclosures), and a substantial portion disclosed
exclusive support from public sources (36% [103/284] of research articles with Funding disclosures), availability of data upon request (25% [17/68] of research articles with Data sharing),
and registration on ClinicalTrials.gov (50% [11/22] of research articles with Protocol registration) (S1 Fig). In 8 (12%) of 68 articles with a Data sharing statement claiming that all data
were available in the text, no raw data were found.
Using information found in PubMed records of these articles alone (as opposed to screening the full text), would have missed most records with indicators of transparency (S1 Table).
Abstracts are very limited in scope, and PubMed records are not tailored to systematically capture these indicators, perhaps with the exception of funding. Still, PubMed records gave information on funding for merely 35% of articles, while funding disclosures were in fact present in
71% of them.
By utilizing data from previous studies [20,22], we observed a marked increase in the proportion of publications reporting COI disclosures (Fig 1B, S2 Table). An increase is also seen
in the availability of Funding disclosures and Data sharing statements, even though

uncertainty is too large to claim trends. For Code sharing and Protocol registration, the numbers have remained low. No apparent trends were observed in statements of Novelty and
Replication.
In our sample, reporting of COI disclosures, Funding disclosures, Data sharing, and Code
sharing were significantly more frequently seen in articles available on PubMed Central
(PMC) (S3 Table). Preclinical research articles reported Funding disclosures more often than
clinical research articles (91% versus 70%), and clinical trials reported Protocol registration
substantially more frequently than the rest (67% versus 3%).

Automated assessment of transparency: Development and validation
across 6,017 PMC articles (2015 to 2019)
We proceeded to test the performance of algorithms automating the process of identifying
indicators of transparency by using a rule-based approach of regular expressions. Three were
developed from scratch (COI disclosure, Funding disclosure, and Protocol registration), and
two were adopted from an already existing library [29] (Data and Code sharing) and customized to enhance efficiency (see Materials and methods). Note that even though in the manual
assessment Data sharing and Code sharing indicators capture any statement about data or
code availability, in the automated assessment, we only capture newly generated open raw data

Fig 2. Validation of algorithms for Data sharing, Code sharing, COI disclosure, Funding disclosure, and Protocol registration in 6,017 PMC articles from 2015 to
2019. The displayed performance was assessed in subsamples from 6,017 PMC articles: 189 research articles for Data sharing (100 positive, 89 negative), 291 research
articles for Code sharing (110 positive, 181 negative), 325 articles for COI disclosure (100 positive, 225 negative), 326 for Funding disclosure (100 positive, 226 negative),
and 308 for Protocol availability (161 positive, 147 negative). All algorithms displayed high accuracy (>94%) and low error in prevalence estimation (�3.6%) compared
to manual assessment. Error, difference between true and estimated prevalence; NPV, negative predictive value; PPV, positive predictive value (precision); Prevalence

or code to align with previous work in this field [29]. In a random unseen sample of 6,017
PMC records from 2015 to 2019, these algorithms predicted Data sharing in 764 (13%) records, Code sharing in 117 (2%), COI disclosure in 4,792 (80%), Funding disclosure in 5,022
(84%), and Protocol registration in 261 (4%); 61 (1%) claimed both Data and Code sharing.
Examples for the presence of any of those indicators can be found in the Supporting information (S2 Fig).
In the tested samples of 6,017 PMC articles, the accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV),
and negative predictive value (NPV) of all 5 algorithms was �88% (Fig 2). Even though all
algorithms were highly specific (>98%), the data and code sharing algorithms were not as sensitive as the rest (76% and 59%, respectively, versus >95% for all other indicators). This was in
part because algorithms did not identify raw data made available as supplements or did not

recognize less popular code repositories (Bitbucket and Open Science Framework [OSF]). The
estimated sensitivity of the code sharing algorithm was particularly driven by a single study that
provided its code as a supplement, but was falsely labeled negative (see Code Sharing in S2 Text).
As such, the algorithm made 1 mistake in 88 manually assessed research articles with no Data or
Code sharing. However, with the vast majority of articles not sharing data or code (5,197/6,017),
this 1 article was dramatically overweighted. This is reflected by the large confidence interval
(34% to 94%), which includes the estimated sensitivity of 73% from a random sample of 800
PMC research articles of 2018 calculated by the original authors of this algorithm [29].
The difference between manually adjudicated indicator prevalence (true) versus machineadjudicated prevalence (estimated) was �1.1% for all algorithms other than for Data sharing,
for which it was 3.6%. By design, the COI disclosure, Funding disclosure, and Protocol registration algorithms had 100% sensitivity and specificity in the training set of 499 articles (2015
to 2018); the Data and Code sharing algorithms had 76% sensitivity and 98% specificity in a
training set of 868 random PubMed articles from 2015 to 2017 [29]. Detailed assessment of
each algorithm can be found in the Supporting information (S2 Text).

Automated assessment of transparency: Transparency across 2.75 million
PMCOA articles (1959 to 2020)
We then proceeded to test the entire PubMed Central Open Access (PMCOA) subset using
these algorithms. We identified 2,751,484 records as of February 29, 2020, of which 2,751,420
were unique (Table 2). For each record, we extracted 158 variables, of which 39 were metadata
(35 from PMC, 2 from National Institutes of Health (NIH) Open Citation Collection (OCC), 2
from Web of Science (WOS), and 1 from SciTech) (S4 Table), and 119 were related to the indicators of transparency (5 for presence/absence of each indicator, 5 with extracted text for each indicator, and 93 indicating which aspects of text were found relevant for each indicator) (S5 Table).
Of these, 2,285,193 (83%) had been labeled as research articles by OCC, and 2,498,496 (91%)
were published from 2000 onwards in a total of 10,570 different journals. Note that open access
records from PMC did not include any supporting information and that the classification of
OCC into research articles is imperfect (see “Sources of metadata” in Materials and methods).
Out of 2,751,420 open access PMC records (1959 to 2020), our algorithms identified mentions of Data sharing in 243,783 (8.9%), Code sharing in 33,405 (1.2%), COI disclosure in
1,886,907 (68.6%), Funding disclosure in 1,858,022 (67.5%), and Protocol registration in
70,469 (2.6%) (Fig 3A, S6 Table). Adjusting for the discrepancies between predicted and true
estimates seen in the validation set, we estimate that Data sharing information was mentioned
in 14.5% (95% CI, 11.0% to 18.8%), Code sharing information in 2.5% (95% CI, 1.2% to 4.7%),
COI disclosure information in 69.5% (95% CI, 69.0% to 70.1%), Funding disclosure information in 67.9% (95% CI, 67.6% to 68.3%), and Protocol registration information in 2.5% (95%
CI, 2.5% to 2.6%). The majority of COI disclosures reported no conflicts of interest (1,531,018;
81%), and the majority of Funding disclosures reported receipt of funds (1,675,513; 90%).
Associations between indicators and literature characteristics are reported in the Supporting
information (S3 Text, S7 Table). Note that unlike in our manual assessment, the numbers
reported in this section refer to the entire literature on PMCOA, not merely research articles;
all analyses were repeated in research articles alone with no meaningful changes.

Note that Country contains more than the total number of countries because many publications report locations
other than country (e.g., state, city, etc.). Similarly, even though we have gone at great length to standardize names of

Field of science are due to many articles not having a PMID (some articles are on PMC but are not admitted to
PubMed). Field of science was taken from SciTech, Citation count from OCC (April 17, 2020), and Journal Impact

has been far more dramatic for COI and Funding disclosures than for Data sharing, Code
sharing, and Protocol registration. Specifically, all indicators have risen from approximately
0% in 1990 to an estimated 15% in 2020 for Data sharing, 3.1% for Code sharing, 90% for COI
disclosures, 85% for Funding disclosures, and 5% for Protocol registration. For research articles, the respective proportions for 2020 are 17%, 3.5%, 91%, 89%, and 5.7%, respectively. The
proportion of publications reporting on these indicators was homogeneous across countries,
with most reporting COI and Funding disclosures, but only the minority reporting Data sharing, Code sharing, or Protocol registration (Fig 4).
In terms of field of science (see S8 Table for examples), all fields reported COI and Funding
disclosures more frequently than other indicators of transparency (Fig 5A; see S9 Table for
example phrases across fields and indicators). However, publications from different fields
tended to report indicators of transparency at substantially different proportions. For example,
publications classified within Biology or Infectious diseases tended to share Data (29% and
17%, respectively) and Funding disclosures (90% and 86%, respectively) more than publications within Medicine (7% for data, 71% for funding) or Health services (3.6% for data, 68%
for funding). On the contrary, publications within Health services were more likely than other
fields of science to share COI disclosures (81.4% versus 77.4%; 95% CI of difference, 3.9% to

3.3%).
We then proceeded to further map indicators of transparency across galaxies of science (Fig
5B). These galaxies were previously developed using 18.2 million PubMed articles published
between 1996 and 2019 and divided into approximately 28,000 clusters of articles [30]. Each
cluster comprises similar articles and is colored according to the field associated with the most
prevalent journals within the cluster. The size of each colored cluster was modified to reflect
the proportion of articles published between 2015 and 2019 that are open access (1,490,270
articles) or report Data sharing (177,175 articles), Code sharing (25,650 articles), COI disclosure (1,263,147 articles), Funding disclosure (1,192,4996 articles), or Protocol registration
(52,798 articles). The most recent 5 years cover more than half of the articles on PMCOA and
were chosen to most accurately portray the current practice of transparency. These galaxies
further corroborate that most recent open access articles share COI and Funding disclosures,
but do not share Data, Code, or Protocol.
Out of 2,477 journals with at least 100 articles on PMCOA between 1990 and 2020, the
majority consistently reported COI disclosures (42% of journals reported them in �90% of
their publications; 64% in �70% of their publications) and Funding disclosures (21% of journals reported them in �90% of their publications; 54% in �70% of their publications), but
only the minority reported consistently on Data sharing (0.1% of journals in �90% of their
publications; 0.5% of journals in �70% of their publications), Protocol registration (only 1
journal in �70% of its publications), or Code sharing (no journal in �70% of its publications;

Fig 4. Indicators of transparency across countries of affiliation for all open access articles on PMC (PMCOA) for 1990–2020. Indicators of transparency are
roughly homogeneously reported across countries. The light green to yellow maps indicate that the majority of publications from most countries reported COI and
Funding disclosures. The purple maps indicate that the majority of publications from most countries did not report any Data, Code, or Protocol sharing. Note that the
country was only reported in 479,843 articles. The data underlying this figure can be found on OSF at http://www.doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/E58WS. COI, Conflict of

Fig 5. Indicators of transparency across fields of science on PMCOA. (A) Reporting of indicators of transparency across fields of
science for all articles on PMCOA since 1990. COI and Funding disclosures are by far the most highly reported indicators within all
fields, whereas Code sharing and Protocol registration are by far the least reported. The indicator with the biggest proportional difference
between minimum and maximum reporting across fields of science was Protocol registration (0.1% versus 5.8%; Coefficient of variation,
130), and the indicator with the smallest proportional difference was Funding disclosure (53.9% versus 90.0%; Coefficient of variation,
14.5). (B) Indicators of transparency in all articles of PMCOA published between 2015 and 2019 across galaxies of science. The galaxy in
gray represents all clusters of articles published between 2015 and 2019. On top of the gray galaxy, we overlaid colored representations of
the proportion of each cluster that is open access or reports on any of the indicators of transparency. The open access galaxy is very
similar to that of COI and Funding disclosures, suggesting that most of the open literature reports on both. A number of Chemistry (blue)
and Biology (green) clusters are smaller in COI disclosure, whereas a number of Health services (red) and Infectious diseases (burgundy)
clusters are smaller in Funding disclosure. Biology (green) and Infectious diseases (burgundy) are pronounced in Data sharing. A very
small proportion of clusters report Code sharing or open Protocol registration—of those, the majority are Biology (green) and Health
services (red) clusters, respectively. The data underlying this figure can be found on OSF at http://www.doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/E58WS.

29%, and 61% have never shared any data, protocol, or code, respectively). These numbers did
not change meaningfully when considering research articles alone.
Out of 609 publishers with at least 100 articles (research or non-research) on PMCOA
between 1990 and 2020, the majority consistently reported COI disclosures (30% had disclosures in at least 90% of articles; 49% had disclosures in at least 70% of articles) and Funding
disclosures (10% had disclosures in �90% of articles; 28% had disclosures in �70%), but only
the minority reported consistently on Data sharing (1 publisher in �70%), Protocol registration (0 in �70%), or Code sharing (0 in �70%) (Fig 6B). However, 71.4% of publishers have
shared a protocol, 70.9% have shared data, and 30% have shared code at least once (i.e., 28.6%,
29.1%, and 70.0% of publishers have never shared protocol, data, or code, respectively). These
numbers did not change meaningfully when considering research articles alone.

Discussion
Our evaluation of 2,751,420 open access PMC articles (1959 to 2020) suggests that there have
been substantial improvements in reporting of COI and Funding disclosures across time, fields
of science, and publication venues, but that Data sharing, Code sharing, and Protocol registration are significantly lagging. It also illustrates that using automated approaches to study and
understand the biomedical literature is possible and can yield insights over and above those
possible with manual assessments of small random samples. This effort has led to the creation
of a database of all open access biomedical literature (2.75 million articles), alongside granular
information about indicators of transparency and metadata integrated from PMC, OCC, and
SciTech that is now openly available (see our Data Availability Statement). We envision that
this resource will encourage future efforts trying to further improve on our openly available
tools and understand the uptake of transparency and reproducibility practices and their
impact on science.
The currently presented algorithms were able to extract relevant text and by construction
make multiple pieces of information about their predictions available. For example, in the case
of COI disclosures, the algorithm may label a text as referring to no conflicts of interest present, commercial interests present, financial disclosures present, receipt of consulting fees, etc.
As such, they can facilitate other teams in building systems on top of this with more nuanced
definitions of COI without having to retrain and recalibrate complex black box systems.
Indeed, we hope that our tools, data, and results set a precedent that can unify, inspire, and
inform future research and practice. Our tools have been open sourced as an R package so that
other teams or individuals may apply them within their collection of articles, improve on their
current implementation, and expand them to indicators of transparency not currently captured; all within 1 unified package. Our data, as indicated above, provide a foundational yet

Fig 6. Indicators of transparency across 2,477 journals and 609 publishers with at least 100 publications on PMCOA between 1990 and 2020. (A)
Proportion of journals with at least a designated proportion of publications reporting on each indicator of transparency. For example, for the graph on Funding
disclosures, approximately 50% of journals (vertical axis) report Funding disclosures in at least approximately 75% of their publications (horizontal axis).
Similarly, they indicate that no journal reports Protocol registration in more than approximately 75% of publications. The concave (bent outward) distribution of
COI and Funding disclosures indicates that most publications in most journals disclose COI or Funding, respectively. However, the convex (bent inward)
distribution of Data sharing, Code sharing, and Protocol registration indicate that most publications do not report on each of these indicators in most journals.
About three quarters of journals have hosted at least 1 publication sharing data, and about one-third of journals have hosted at least 1 publication sharing code.
(B) Proportion of publishers with at least a designated proportion of articles (research or non-research) reporting on each indicator of transparency. For
example, these graphs indicate that approximately 50% of journals (vertical axis) report Funding disclosures in at least approximately 50% of their articles
(horizontal axis). Similarly, no publisher reports Data sharing in more than approximately 75% of articles. As in (A), the shapes of these distributions indicate
that most articles of most publishers report on COI and Funding, but most do not report on Data sharing, Code sharing, or Protocol registration. Almost three
quarters of publishers host articles that never report Code sharing, and roughly one-quarter of publishers host articles that never report Data sharing. The data

flexible map of transparency to expedite further research in the area, such that future researchers may investigate these indicators across different definitions or different subsets of the literature or integrate these data within their own data pipeline such that any re-extraction is
avoided. Finally, our results help us monitor the status quo and suggest the existence of different practices across publishers and disciplines, providing an opportunity to reflect and learn
from the experience of each other.
In that vein, our results provide an opportunity for publishers, journals, and the National
Library of Medicine (NLM) to standardize reporting of such indicators. Even though the NLM
provides XML tags for labeling aspects of an article in a machine-readable way [31], our data
illustrate that when these exist (e.g., COI and Funding disclosures), they are used by a minority
of journals and that these do not exist for many other important aspects of transparency (e.g.,
Protocol registration and Code sharing). Given our data, most journals use different language
when referring to such indicators, and only a minority of journals seem to use appropriate tags
to label transparency statements, and no journal used purpose-built tags for Protocol registration or Code sharing. A number of initiatives aim to convert PDFs to tagged files [32], but the
institution of a journal-wide requirement for standard language and tagging would enormously reinforce these efforts. In the meantime, both PubMed and other journals can, if they
so desire, use our openly available algorithms to improve the availability of information about
transparency.

Limitations
First, the performance of our algorithms was assessed in a recent sample of PMC. As such, we
cannot be certain of their performance across a sample of articles outside PMC, older articles,
or articles published in the future. Similarly, we cannot be certain that average performance is
representative of performance within specific fields of science, journals, or publishers. However, the majority of articles in the published literature have been published after 2000, and the
findings of our algorithms corroborate those seen in the current and previous manual assessments [20,22]. Second, we are only using the Open Access Subset of PMC. There are other
freely available articles within as well as outside PMC that we did not assess. However, previous
publications have illustrated that the Open Access Subset is of similar composition as the nonOpen Access Subset of PMC [22], and PMC represents about half of the recently published literature available on PubMed. Third, algorithms in general do not guarantee that the statements identified are either accurate, full, or true. This is why we have designed our algorithms
to not only extract text, but also indicate why an article was labeled as including information
on an indicator. We hope that future work will study these questions further. Fourth, some of
the XML versions used in our biomedical open literature–wide search do not include the COI

or Funding disclosures that were included in the published PDF. Nevertheless, given that the
numbers identified are very similar to those of manual labeling, we do not believe that this is a
significant concern. Finally, even though we have assessed all open access articles on PMC,
some of these articles cannot be expected to share Data, Code, or a Protocol registration (e.g.,
an opinion paper). Even though future work is necessary to identify such contextual characteristics as the type of article, we have mitigated their impact by incorporating their existence
within the evaluation of our algorithms and, where meaningful, providing assessments of indicators within research articles alone. However, it should be noted that many of the articles
labeled by OCC as non-research may in fact contain empirical research (see “Sources of metadata” in Materials and methods).
Allowing for these caveats, we provide tools that can expedite the massive assessment of the
scientific literature for the most important indicators of transparency and map such indicators
across time, countries, journals, publishers, and disciplines. This may help reinforce efforts for
making such transparency features even more routine across published articles and understand where and how critical resources may be invested in improving transparency in the biomedical literature.

Materials and methods
This manuscript was prepared using guidance from the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guidelines [33] for observational studies
and the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis
Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) guidelines for reporting prediction models [34].

Data sources
PubMed. First, we randomly assembled a retrospective cohort of 520 records made available on PubMed between 2015 and 2018. PubMed is maintained by the United States NLM
and provides citations to 30,732,929 references of the biomedical and life sciences literature (as
of March 2020), 4,552,825 of which were published between 2015 and 2018 [35]. All English
articles published between 2015 and 2018 were eligible for analysis.
PubMed Central. PMC is a free full-text archive for a subset of the publications available
on PubMed. It was set up in 2000 and includes publications from journals that have agreed to
either share all of their publications, NIH-funded publications, or a select subset of their publications [35]. Out of 5,747,776 publications made available on PubMed between 2015 and 2019
(in terms of Entrez Date), 2,497,046 (43.4%) were also made available on PMC. We randomly
identified and downloaded the PDF of 6,017 of these records.
PubMed Central Open Access Subset. As of February 29, 2020, out of 6,016,911 records
ever made available on PMC (1795 to 2020), 2,754,689 are part of the PMCOA [36]; not all
articles on PMC are part of PMCOA. These articles are made available under a Creative Commons or similar license, and their full text (but not their supplements) may be downloaded in
bulk (as XML files) and used for research; these are the publications that were used to estimate
the open access–wide biomedical literature degree of transparency.
Sources of metadata. We extracted all metadata related to the articles of interest provided
by PubMed and PMC (e.g., journal of publication, publisher, authors, affiliations, etc.). For all
manually assessed articles, we extracted all social media–related data from Altmetric on May
30, 2019. Altmetric captures and tracks the use and sharing of articles across social media. For
all manually assessed articles, we extracted citation counts from Crossref on May 30, 2019; for
automatically assessed articles, we extracted citation counts from the NIH OCC (iCite 2.0)
[37] on April 17, 2020. OCC is a recent initiative of the NLM, which attempts to map all

citations from PubMed records to PubMed records and make them openly available. Note that
OCC only has citation data for articles with a PubMed ID (PMID), so for articles with a
PubMed Central ID (PMCID) but no PMID, we had no citation data. We also used OCC to
extract whether an article is considered a research article or not—this is based on definitions
by PubMed and considers articles such as those labeled by PubMed as journal articles, randomized controlled trials, or observational studies as research articles and articles such as
those labeled as reviews, editorials, news, or comments as non-research [38]—it should be
noted that in our work we identified that PubMed annotations do not always agree with PMC
and that 47,631 articles labeled by PMC as “research articles” were classified as a non-research
type by PubMed (and thus, iCite)—in these cases, we maintained the definition of research by
iCite to remain internally consistent. We used 2018 journal impact factors made available by
InCites Journal Citation Reports of WOS (the latest available at the time). We used the categorizations of PMC articles across fields of science provided by the galaxy of science developed
by SciTech (author: K.W.B.) [39]. Briefly, this approach clusters similar articles together and
allocates each cluster to the field of the dominant journal within that cluster. Note that using
this approach, it may happen that, for example, articles from medical journals are labeled as
“Chemistry” if they end up in a cluster dominated by articles from chemistry journals. Also
note that this galaxy of science is based on PubMed, for which reason articles found on PMC
but not on PubMed have not been given a field allocation—this also applies to OCC.

Manual assessment of transparency and reproducibility across 499 PubMed
articles (2015 to 2018)
Extraction of article characteristics. For each article, we gathered the following information: PMID, PMCID, title, authors, year of publication, journal, first author country of affiliation, field of study (as provided by WOS; more information in our protocol [40]), and type of
publication (e.g., research article, review article, case series, etc.) as detailed in our protocol
[40].
Extraction of indicators of transparency and reproducibility. Two reviewers (S.S. and
D.G.C.I.) used a previously published protocol from Wallach and colleagues [40] to extract
appropriate information from eligible articles.
We first extracted any mention of a COI or funding disclosures from all abstracts and fulltext articles in English. Then, for all English records with empirical data (henceforth referred
to as “research articles”), we further extracted whether (a) the abstract and/or full-text of each
eligible record mentions any protocol registration (whether for the whole study or part of the
study), data sharing, or code sharing; and whether (b) the abstract and/or introduction of each
eligible record implies any novelty (e.g., “our study is the first to identify this new protein,”
etc.) or that at least part of this study represents a replication of previous work (e.g., “our study
replicates previously reported results in a new population,” etc.). We further extracted whether
(a) COI disclosures mentioned any conflict or not; (b) disclosures of funding mentioned any
of public or private funds; and (c) whether websites included within data sharing statements
were indeed accessible. In addition to the data extracted on the basis of the aforementioned
protocol, for each one of the extracted indicators, we also extracted the text in which the information was identified to facilitate our work on automated extraction of these indicators. We
only considered clear statements of these indicators, did not attempt to identify whether these
statements were complete (e.g., did the authors report all of their conflicts of interest?) or
truthful (e.g., has this finding truly never been published before?), and did not consider statements that were not included in the PubMed site or full text.

Note that as per the Wallach and colleagues protocol and in a deviation from Iqbal and colleagues, which counted all studies with Supporting information as potentially containing a partial/complete protocol, in this study, we downloaded and examined all Supporting
information to verify whether they indeed contain any of data, code, or protocol registration.
Given differences in languages between fields, it should be noted that by protocol registration,
we refer to active preregistration and public availability of a study protocol, such as those
found for clinical trials on ClinicalTrials.gov.
Note also that we found the Novelty and Replication indicators particularly ambiguous, for
which reason we have created a document with further specifications of nontrivial cases (S1
Text). After compiling this document, we proceeded to have both main reviewers (S.S. and D.
G.C.I.) reassess and cross-check all of their articles, to reduce variability in labeling due to systematic reviewer differences.
Information about 40 randomly identified articles was extracted by 3 reviewers (S.S., D.G.
C.I., and J.D.W.). Upon studying discrepancies and clarifying aspects of the protocol, 2 reviewers (S.S. and D.G.C.I.) extracted relevant information, each from 240 articles. Any uncertainties were discussed between all 3 reviewers to maintain a homogeneous approach.
Discrepancies were identified in adjudication of novelty and replication, for which reason
these indicators were re-extracted for each article, and all unclear articles were discussed
between reviewers. Information about concordance is available as a Supporting information
(S10 Table). All extracted data were harmonized into a unified database, which can be accessed
on OSF at https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/E58WS.

Automated assessment of transparency: Development
We adjusted a previously reported algorithm developed by N.R. [29] to identify data and code
sharing and developed algorithms to identify COI disclosures, funding disclosures, and protocol registration statements. All algorithms were constructed to take a PDF file of a typical article available on PubMed and output (a) whether it has identified a statement of relevance; (b)
why it is of relevance; and (c) what the exact phrase of relevance is. This flexibility was built in
(a) to help integrate these algorithms into the researcher workflow by combining manual and
automated inspection; (b) to allow for different definitions of the indicators by different investigators (e.g., consider only COI disclosures that were specifically included as a stand-alone
statement, rather than within acknowledgments); and (c) to ease adjudication of their performance. All algorithms, including those for data and code sharing, were further adopted to
work with XML files from PMC (i.e., using the NLM XML structure).
Before using any of the algorithms, we preprocessed the text to fix problems with text
extraction from PDF files (e.g., inappropriately broken lines, non-UTF8 symbols, etc.), remove
non-informative punctuation (e.g., commas, full stops that do not represent the end of a
phrase [e.g., “no. 123”], etc.), and remove potentially misleading text (e.g., references, etc.). For
COI disclosures, Funding disclosures, and Protocol registration, text was not converted to
lower or uppercase, we did not use stemming (e.g., we did not convert “processing” into “process”), and we did not remove stop words (e.g., “and,” “or,” etc.)—even though these are frequent preprocessing steps in natural language processing, we found these nuances informative
and exploitable. Text was tokenized into phrases for data and code sharing and tokenized into
paragraphs for all other algorithms; for the algorithms we developed from scratch, we used a
custom-made tokenizer because already available tokenizers were not found to be accurate or
flexible enough. Even though we also considered using machine learning approaches to extract
these indicators, we found that the current approach performed well and afforded a level of
interpretability and flexibility in definitions that is not easily achievable by alternative methods.

All programming was done in R [41] and particularly depended on the packages tidyverse
[42], stringr [43], and xml2 [43,44].
The programs were structured into several different kinds of functions. Helper functions
(n = 7) were developed to help in creating complex regular expressions more easily and in
dealing with XML files. Preprocessing functions (n = 9) were developed to correct mistakes
introduced by the conversion from PDF to text and turn the text into as conducive a document
to text mining as possible. Masking functions (n = 7) were developed to mask words or phrases
that may induce mislabeling (e.g., in searching for funding disclosures, we are masking mentions of finances within COI disclosures to avoid mislabeling those statements as funding disclosures). Labeling functions (n = 81; 20 for COI, 39 for Funding, and 22 for Registration)
used regular expressions to identify phrases of interest (described below). The regular expressions of these labeling functions also take into account transformations of the text to improve
performance (e.g., labeling functions can capture both “we report conflicts of interest” and
“conflicts of interest are reported”). Localization functions (n = 3) were developed to identify
specific locations within the text (e.g., acknowledgments). Labeling functions that were more
sensitive were only applied within small localized sections of the text to reduce mislabeling.
Negation functions (n = 7) were developed to negate potentially false labels by the labeling
functions. XML functions (n = 17) were developed to preprocess and take advantage of the
NLM XML structure. A dictionary was constructed with all phrases and synonyms used by the
regular expressions (n = 637).
Data and code sharing. A member of our team (N.R.) had already developed algorithms
to automatically extract information about data and code sharing [29]. Briefly, these algorithms use regular expressions to identify whether an article mentions (a) a general database in
which data are frequently deposited (e.g., “figshare”); (b) a field-specific database in which
data are frequently deposited (e.g., dbSNP); (c) online repositories in which data/code are frequently deposited (e.g., GitHub); (d) language referring to the availability of code (e.g.,
“python script”); (e) language referring to commonly shared file formats (e.g., “csv”); (f) language referring to the availability of data as a supplement (e.g., “supplementary data”); and (g)
language referring to the presence of a data sharing statement (e.g., “data availability statement”). It finally checks whether these were mentioned in the context of positive statements
(e.g., “can be downloaded”) or negative statements (e.g., “not deposited”) to produce its final
adjudication. This adjudication (a) indicates whether a data/code sharing statement is present;
(b) which aspect of data sharing was detected (e.g., mention of a general database); and (c)
extracts the phrase in which this was detected. In this study, these algorithms were customized
to avoid text in tables and references and run faster—this is the version of the algorithms that
was used to study the PMCOA. It should be noted that, unlike in our manual assessment, these
algorithms were designed to capture data or code sharing where new data are actually made
available and avoid claims of data sharing, such as “upon request.”
Conflict of interest disclosures. Briefly, our approach recognizes COI disclosures using
regular expressions to identify whether a publication mentions (a) phrases commonly associated with a COI disclosure (e.g., “conflicts of interest,” “competing interests,” etc.); (b) titles of
sections associated with a COI disclosure (e.g., “Conflicts of Interests,” “Competing Interests,”
etc.); (c) phrases associated with COI disclosures (e.g., “S.S. received commercial benefits from
GSK,” “S.S. maintains a financial relationship with GSK,” etc.); (d) phrases associated with declaration of no COI (e.g., “Nothing to disclose.,” “No competing interests.,” etc.); and (e)
acknowledgment sections containing phrases with words associated with COI disclosures
(e.g., “fees,” “speaker bureau,” “advisory board,” etc.).
Funding disclosures. Briefly, our approach recognizes funding disclosures using regular
expressions to identify whether a publication mentions (a) phrases commonly associated with

PLOS BIOLOGY

a funding disclosure (e.g., “This study was financially supported by . . .,” “We acknowledge
financial support by . . .,” etc.); (b) titles of sections associated with a funding disclosure (e.g.,
“Funding,” “Financial Support,” etc.); (c) phrases commonly associated with support by a
foundation (e.g., “S.S. received financial support by the NIH,” etc.); (d) references to authors
(e.g., “This author has received no financial support for this research.,” etc.); (e) thank you
statements (e.g., “We thank the NIH for its financial support.,” etc.); (f) mentions of awards or
grants (e.g., “This work was supported by Grant no. 12345,” etc.); (g) mentions of no funding
(e.g., “No funding was received for this research”); and (h) acknowledgment sections containing phrases with relevant words (e.g., “funded by NIH,” etc.). This algorithm was also designed
to avoid mentions of funding related to COI disclosures (e.g., “S.S. has financial relationships
with GSK,” etc.).
Protocol registration statements. Briefly, we recognize registration statements using regular expressions developed to identify the following: (a) mentions of registration on
ClinicalTrials.gov and other clinical trial registries (e.g., “This study was registered on
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT12345678),” etc.); (b) mentions of registration on PROSPERO (e.g.,
“This study was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42015023210),” etc.); (c) mentions of registration of a protocol or a study regardless of registry (e.g., “Our protocol was registered on the
Chinese Clinical Trials Register (ChiCTR-IOR-12345678),” etc.); (d) mentions of research
being available on a specific register regardless of registry (e.g., “Our research protocol is available on the ClinicalTrials.gov registry (NCT12345678),” etc.); (e) titles commonly associated
with registration regardless of registry (e.g., “Registration Number,” “Trial registration:
NCT12345678,” etc.); (f) previously published protocols of studies (e.g., “Our study protocol
was previously published (Serghiou et al. 2018),” etc.); and (g) registration statements within
funding disclosures (e.g., “Funded by the NIH. SPECS trial (NCT12345678),” etc.). This algorithm was developed to specifically avoid mentions of registry or registration that were not relevant (e.g., “This study enrolled patients in our hospital registry.,” etc.) or registrations with no
open protocol availability (e.g., “Our protocol was approved by the IRS (registration no.
123456)”).

Automated assessment of transparency: Validation across 6,017 PMC
articles (2015 to 2019)
Data acquisition. The 6,017 records obtained from PMC were used to (a) calibrate the
algorithms developed in the initial dataset to the PMC dataset and (b) test the algorithms in
previously unseen data. We then proceeded by using an importance sampling approach. First,
we tested all 6,017 records using the algorithms developed in the training set of 499 manually
assessed articles. Then, for each algorithm, we manually assessed 100 of the 6,017 articles predicted positive and 100 of the articles predicted negative. Note that the articles predicted positive or negative were different for each algorithm, hence each algorithm was not necessarily
assessed in the same articles. Separately for articles predicted positive or negative, if at least 1
mistake was found, we held out 225 articles of the unseen data as a test set and redeveloped the
algorithm in the remaining data until no meaningful improvement was seen. A flowchart has
been made available as a Supporting information (S3 Fig). In the case of registration, only 261
out of 6,017 articles were predicted positive, for which reason we only held 161 articles as a test
set. More details on our approach can be found in the Supporting information (S2 Text). All of
these samples and validations have been made available (see Data Sharing statement).
Data and code sharing. All algorithms were tested in a sample of the PMC that had not
been seen before testing (the test set, algorithm predictions, and our manual assessment are all
openly available; see the Data Availability Statement). Data sharing was evaluated in 100/764

research articles predicted to share data and 89/5,253 predicted to not share data (less than 100
because not all articles were research articles). Code sharing was evaluated in 117/117 articles
predicted to share code, in 93/764 articles predicted to share data, and in 88/5,253 articles predicted to not share data (7 of data sharing and 1 of non-data sharing articles had been included
in the code sharing dataset).
COI and funding disclosures. The COI and Funding disclosure algorithms were redeveloped in the articles predicted negative for each of the 2 algorithms, respectively, out of 6,017.
To do so, we set aside 225 articles and then redeveloped the algorithms in the remaining data.
When confident that further development would not meaningfully improve performance, we
retested each respective test set of 225 articles with the respective algorithm. As such, COI disclosures were evaluated in 100/4,792 articles predicted positive and 226/1,225 articles predicted negative (1 extra was mistakenly included and not subsequently removed to avoid bias).
Funding disclosures were evaluated in 100/5,022 predicted positive and 225/995 predicted
negative.
Protocol registration. For Protocol registration, we used a modified approach because it
was very scarcely reported, as only 261/6,017 articles were predicted positive. As such, the algorithm was redeveloped in the first 100 articles predicted positive and tested in the remaining
161. Second, out of 5,756 articles predicted negative, it was very unlikely that the general article
would be a false negative. As such, we employed an importance sampling approach (similar to
that for code sharing), such that for each article we identified whether (a) it mentions any
words of relevance to protocol registration (e.g., “registration,” “trial,” etc.); (b) whether it
mentions any words related to the title of a methods section (e.g., “Methods,” “Materials and
methods,” etc.); (c) whether it mentions an NCT code, which is the code given to randomized
controlled trials on ClinicalTrials.gov; and (d) whether the redeveloped algorithm relabeled a
previously predicted negative article as positive. Out of 5,756 predicted negative, we used a
stratified/importance sampling procedure by sampling 21/3,248 articles deemed irrelevant
(i.e., do not mention the words regist� /trial/NCT), 9/451 that were deemed relevant, 44/1,951
out of those that were deemed relevant and had a Methods section, 58/91 that contained an
NCT identification number, and all 15/15 that the new algorithm predicted as positive. A
detailed breakdown is presented in Table 3.

Transparency across the open access biomedical literature
First, we downloaded all of the PMCOA with clear commercial and noncommercial use labels
in XML format from the PMC FTP Service [36]. Then, we processed all articles in batches of
4,096 articles and in parallel across 8 CPU cores to check for the aforementioned transparency

indicators and extract metadata. Running the COI, Funding, and Protocol registration algorithms together in this fashion led to a mean processing time of 0.025 seconds per paper; running the Data and Code sharing algorithms together in this fashion led to a mean processing
time of 0.106 seconds per paper. We finally combined the extracted data with data from OCC
(citation counts and whether this is a research article) and SciTech field of science.
Note that certain variables from PMCOA were not reported in a consistent standardized
form (e.g., country could be reported as “USA,” “United States,” “US,” “Texas, USA,” etc.)—
we corrected all variations that occurred 20 or more times into a standardized form (e.g., if
“Texas, USA” occurred 20 or more times, we changed it into “USA”)—this is a time-consuming process, and we do not believe that standardizing variations that occur less than 20 times
would meaningfully change the results presented. Data were standardized to the most common label to start with (i.e., if “BMJ” occurred more commonly than “British Medical Journal,”
then the two were standardized into “BMJ”), apart from countries, which were standardized to
the name given in ggplot2 [45], which is an R package that we used to create maps. All maps
are in the public domain (http://www.naturalearthdata.com/about/terms-of-use/).
We used these data to create univariable descriptive statistics and frequency counts across
journals, publishers, country of affiliation, and field of science, as they were reported by
PMCOA and SciTech. Unlike the preplanned analysis of indicator prevalence and distribution
across time and field, all other analyses were exploratory. To mitigate data dredging inherent
to such exploratory analyses, these analyses were developed in a random sample of 10,000 records and then applied to all data.
All variables considered were presence and text of COI/funding disclosures, registration
statements, title, authors, affiliations, journal, publisher, type of article, references, number of
figures, number of tables, citations, and field of science. Our a priori associations of interest
were the distribution of indicators across time and across fields of science, as they are defined
by SciTech.
It should be noted that certain journals (e.g., Scientific Reports and Nature Communications) make conflicts of interest disclosures available in the published PDF version of an article,
but do not always include those in the XML versions. As such, our estimate of the presence of
conflicts of interest in the open biomedical literature is a valid estimate of which statements
are included in the PMC version of the text, but a relative underestimation in terms of what
statements are included in the print versions.

Statistical information
Homogeneity between the 2 reviewers as well as with the previous reviewer (J.W.) was assessed
by quantifying the frequency of identification of each feature by each reviewer. These frequencies were statistically compared using Fisher exact test of independence and calculating a
2-sided p-value—we did not use common measures of inter-rater reliability because each
reviewer assessed a different random batch of articles. Validation of the automated feature
extraction algorithms was evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity (= recall), specificity, PPV and
NPV (PPV = precision), prevalence of the indicator, and error between estimated and true
prevalence (in terms of absolute difference) (for a detailed explanation of definitions and procedures, see S4 Text). The 95% confidence interval around the diagnostic metrics was built
using the nonparametric bootstrap with 5,000 iterations and taking the 2.5th and 97.5th quantiles—in building this confidence interval, we considered the variability introduced by all sampling steps (i.e., sampling 6,017 from PMC and sampling 225 from those predicted positive or
negative). For the whole PMCOA, we produced univariable frequency statistics for all variables
and frequency statistics of each indicator variable across years, journal, publisher, country, and

field of science. The estimate of indicator prevalence was adjusted by considering the observed
PPV and NPV in the test set, such that for an observed prevalence p, the adjusted prevalence
was p×PPV+(1−p)×(1−NPV). p-Values were produced using nonparametric tests (Kruskal–
Wallis test for continuous data and Fisher exact test for discrete). Correlation coefficients were
calculated using the Spearman correlation coefficient.

S1 Fig. Types of data sharing statements and funding disclosures in 349 research articles
(2015–2018). Of 68 research articles with Data sharing statements, most claimed availability
upon request or made use of public data. Of those actively sharing new data, most made their
data available on an online repository (e.g., GenBank); 8 articles stated that all of their data
were available in the text or supplements, but we could not locate any such raw data—all 8
were published in PLOS ONE; 4 articles only shared PCR primers; 4 articles actively indicated
that they are not currently sharing their data. Of 284 research articles with Funding disclosures, most reported public funds (e.g., NIH) or funds from NGOs (e.g., Gates Foundation).
Very few indicated no or private funding. The data underlying this figure can be found on

containing the indicator of interest) or Negative (i.e., not containing the indicator of interest)
by the algorithm developed in the initial sample of 499 articles and the updated algorithm
using data from the 6,017 articles. Both correct, this text was labeled correctly by both algorithms; Updated correct, this text was labeled correctly only by the updated algorithm; Both
wrong, this text that was labeled incorrectly by both algorithms. Notice that the green statements for COI disclosures, Funding disclosures, and Protocol registration are very explicit
about their content, the orange statements slightly less so, and the red statements even less
explicit—this illustrates how the algorithms were updated to capture more of the less explicit
statements (see S2 Text). Note that these statements were purposefully selected because they
are small and clearly exemplify the points made—to access the complete evaluation of these
algorithms and all sentences classified correctly or incorrectly, please see our data on OSF at

each cluster, the most prevalent journal within that cluster, and the title of a representative
review for each cluster. Each cluster, journal, and name within each field has been separated by
a semi-colon. Two fields were excluded (EARTH and HUMANITIES) due to the 250 papers

counts and was inspected from top to bottom for succinct representative phrases. The text was
truncated to fit in 3 lines and any truncated text is denoted as “[. . .]”. The extracted text for
“Code sharing” in Humanities is a false positive—2 (0.5%) texts from the Humanities were
