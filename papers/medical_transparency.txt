Abstract

42

Background: Transparency in health research is crucial as it allows for the scrutiny and replication of

43

findings, fosters confidence in scientific outcomes, and ultimately contributes to the advancement of

44

knowledge and the betterment of society.

45

Aim: We aimed to assess five transparency practices in scientific publications (data availability, code

46

availability, protocol registration, conflicts of interest (COI) and funding disclosures) from open-access

47

articles published in medical journals.

48

Methods: We searched and exported all open-access articles from Science Citation Index Expanded

49

(SCIE)-indexed journals through the Europe PubMed Central database published until March 16, 2024.

50

Basic journal- and article-related information was retrieved from the database. We then assessed five

51

transparency practices in the articles using the rtransparent package in R.

52

Results: The analysis included 2,002,955 open-access articles from SCIE-indexed medical journals

53

(open-access percentage=59.0%). Of these, 87.5% (95% CI: 87.4%-87.5%) disclosed COI and 80.1%

54

(95% CI: 80.0%-80.1%) disclosed funding. Protocol registration was declared in 6.6% (95% CI: 6.6%-

55

6.6%), data sharing in 7.6% (95% CI: 7.6%-7.6%), and code sharing in 1.4% (95% CI: 1.4%-1.4%) of

56

the articles. More than 76.0% declared at least two transparency practices, while all five practices were

57

declared in less than 0.02%. The data showed an increasing trend in all transparency practices since the

58

late 2000s. Articles published in journals with higher impact factors and articles receiving more

59

citations had increased odds of COI and funding disclosures, as well as data and code sharing. There

60

were notable differences in transparency practices across the disciplines.

61

Conclusion: While most articles had COI and funding disclosures, adherence to other transparency

62

practices was grossly insufficient. To increase protocol registration, data, and code sharing, much

63

stronger incentives and mandates are needed from all stakeholders.

66

Background

67

Recent recognition of health research transparency, essential for accountability, has resulted in

68

stringent disclosure requirements by academic, medical institutions, and voluntary industry and

69

publisher policies (1,2). Although global regulatory bodies, funding agencies, and ethics boards

70

supervise medical research, transparency and disclosure practices are still inconsistent and incomplete

71

(3,4). Research conducted by industry, academia, or their collaboration equally has deficiencies in

72

transparency (2,5). Despite publishers' policies, ethical mandates, and mission statements (6), academic

73

medical centers show poor performance and significant variation in disseminating clinical trial results

74

following transparency practices (7). Transparency in research is pivotal for accountability and trust in

75

results and upholds the ethical responsibilities of researchers, editors, publishers, and funders (8–12).

76

Inefficient use of primarily public or non-profit research funding significantly disadvantages patients

77

and society. Therefore, it is crucial to continuously improve, investigate and monitor research

78

transparency. Key indicators of research transparency include data sharing, code sharing, disclosures of

79

conflicts of interest, funding acknowledgments, and protocol registration (13). Data sharing is more

80

common in non-COVID-19 articles (12%) than in COVID-19 studies (4%) (14). A systematic review

81

of 105 meta-research studies, analyzing 2,121,580 articles across 31 specialties, uncovered substantial

82

transparency challenges (15). Issues include low declared (8%) and actual (2%) public data availability,

83

minimal public code sharing (<0.5%), and inconsistent journal data-sharing policy adherence. This

84

review also noted discrepancies between declared and actual data sharing practices and challenges in

85

privately obtaining data and code from authors (15). These findings highlight the pressing need to

86

enhance transparency, particularly during public health crises.

87

Our meta-research study assessed research transparency regarding data and code sharing, conflict of

88

interest (COI) and funding disclosure, and protocol registration across all medical specialties. Through

89

programmatic and comprehensive analysis, we aimed to identify patterns and areas most needing

90

improvement.

91

92

Methods

93

The protocol of this descriptive study was published on the Open Science Framework (OSF) website

94

(https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/J57BG). All the code and data associated with the study were shared

95

through both its OSF repository (https://osf.io/zbc6p/) and GitHub (https://github.com/choxos/medical-

96

transparency). To ensure transparency and facilitate the reproducibility of our analyses, a PDF

97

document containing the codes and corresponding outputs is provided in Appendix 1.

98

Data sources and study selection

99

Initially, we searched records within journals listed in the 59 disciplines of the “Clinical Medicine”

100

section in the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) version 2020. This search was performed using

101

the Europe PubMed Central (EPMC) database until February 28, 2022. We updated the search on

102

March 16, 2024. The EPMC database encompasses all records found in PubMed and PubMed Central

103

records and allows automated retrieval of full-texts of EPMC open-access records. Remarkably, what is

104

being called here “EPMC open-access articles” do not include all “open-access” labeled articles (e.g.,

105

by the journals/publishers), because some of those articles are still subject to traditional copyright

106

restrictions. Thus, their full texts cannot be accessed via EPMC.

107

Using the metareadr package (16), we retrieved the full texts of all identified open-access records in

108

XML format from the EPMC database. Concurrently, we extracted descriptive details for each journal

109

and article, including publisher, publication year, and citations linked to the article and journal, directly

110

from the EPMC database. We only included research articles (PUB_TYPE:"research-article")

111

and reviews (PUB_TYPE:"review-article" OR PUB_TYPE:"systematic-review") for

112

our final analyses.

113

To identify trials, we created a database of trials by searching for articles that had

114

(PUB_TYPE:"Randomized Controlled Trial" OR PUB_TYPE:"Clinical Trial"

115

OR PUB_TYPE:"Clinical Trial, Phase III" OR PUB_TYPE:"Clinical Trial,

116

Phase IV") tags as their article type using the europepmc package. Articles in our data set that

117

appeared

118

(PUB_TYPE:"review-article" OR PUB_TYPE:"systematic-review") were detected

119

as reviews.

120

We used the Scimago Journal & Country Rank 2022 (SJR, https://www.scimagojr.com) to extract the

121

publisher of the journals.

122

Data extraction and synthesis

123

We used the rtransparent package (17), a validated and automated programmatic tool (13), to identify

124

five transparent practices from the full texts we were able to download from EPMC:

Funding disclosures: The disclosure of the sources of financial support for the research,
promoting transparency regarding the possible influence of funding organizations.

5.

Protocol registration: The public disclosure of research protocols before conducting a study
designed to reduce bias and increase transparency in the research process.

138

The package uses a standardized vocabulary to identify transparency indicators in EPMC XML files. It

139

detects keywords related to COI disclosure, such as “conflicts of interest,” “competing interests,” or

140

“nothing to disclose,” in article section titles or bodies. The tool recognizes all mentions of COI and

141

funding disclosures and treats “nothing to disclose” statements as an indication of transparency, similar

142

to actual conflict disclosures.

143

To assess data and code sharing, the rtransparent tool detects mentions that indicate that they are

144

shared either as supplemental content, in general repositories (e.g., figshare, OSF, GitHub), or in field-

145

specific repositories (e.g., dbSNP, ProteomeXchange, GenomeRNAi). Items that state “data available

146

upon request” are not considered data sharing due to the unlikelihood of data acquisition (18). The

147

rtransparent tool demonstrates robust validation, with high sensitivity and specificity for detecting

148

transparency indicators: conflict of interest disclosure (sensitivity 99.2%, specificity 99.5%), funding

disclosure (sensitivity 99.7%, specificity 98.1%), protocol registration (sensitivity 95.5%, specificity

150

99.7%), data sharing (sensitivity 75.8%, specificity 98.6%), and code sharing (sensitivity 58.7%,

151

specificity 99.7%) (13).

152

Data analysis

153

First, we computed the percentage of articles with full-texts available via EPMC (EPMC open-access

154

records) out of the total number of articles within the database. Alongside providing descriptive

155

statistics for the obtained sample, we reported transparency practices categorized by publication type.

156

We also determined and reported the number of transparency practices that articles with available full-

157

text declared within each publication type, ranging from 0 to 5 practices. Furthermore, we charted

158

differences in transparency practices between 59 distinct clinical medicine disciplines over time. The

159

sensitivity and specificity of the rtransparent tool (17) were used to generate 95% confidence intervals

160

(CIs) for the estimates of the transparency practices. We used visual presentation and Pearson's

161

product-moment correlation to analyze the yearly trend in transparency practices. We used logistic

162

regression adjusted by year of publication to test the relationship between transparency indicators and

163

journal impact factor or received citations. We also used a random intercept generalized linear model to

164

investigate the trends of transparency practices among different medical disciplines.

167

General characteristics

168

As of March 16, 2024, EPMC contained 3,397,155 articles from the SCIE-indexed medical journals in

169

total. Of these, 2,002,955 (59.0%) records had full text available for download. Of the articles, 40,307

170

(2.0%) were published before 2000, 812,146 (40.5%) in the 2010s, and 1,065,770 (53.2%) after 2020.

171

The articles came from 3,458 journals, led by the International Journal of Environmental Research and

172

Public Health (n=59,448, 3.0%), Frontiers in Immunology (n=32,224, 1.6%), and Medicine (Baltimore)

190

Transparency practices overall

191

Of the analyzed full-text articles, 88.8% (95% CI: 88.8%-88.9%) disclosed a COI. Funding disclosures

192

were present in 82.2% (82.1%-82.2%) of articles. Pre-publication registration was mentioned in 7.0%

193

(6.9%-7.0%) and data sharing in 8.0% (8.0%-8.0%) of articles. Code sharing was reported in 1.5%

194

(1.5%-1.5%) (Figure 1A - left). More than 78.3% mentioned at least two transparency indicators, while

195

0.02% complied with all five.

196

The left-hand side of Figures 1B and 1C show the adherence to transparency practices in reviews and

197

trials. Reviews (92.2%, 92.1%-92.3%) and trials (93.1%, 92.9%-93.2%) had higher COI disclosure

198

than all articles. Trials (88.0%, 87.8%-88.2%) mentioned funding disclosure more often than all articles

199

but reviews less often (77.4%, 77.2%-77.5%). Protocol registration was mentioned in 59.6% (59.3%-

200

60.0%) of the trials whereas reviews (6.5%, 6.5%-6.6%) mentioned preregistration less often compared

201

to all articles. Data and code sharing were less often reported in reviews and trials than in all articles.

202

A visual analysis of the data since the end of the 2000s shows a steady increase in the proportion of

203

articles reporting transparency practices (Figure 1, right). Pearson's product-moment correlation

204

between publication year and transparency practices was highest for funding disclosure (0.716) and

205

lowest for code sharing (0.521). All the P-values were <0.001 (Appendix 1).

Transparency practices by medical disciplines

223

Conflict of Interest Disclosure

224

The highest rates of COI disclosures were found in Rheumatology (98.1%), Primary Health Care

225

(97.4%) and Emergency Medicine (96.8%). On the lower end, Medicine, Legal showed 61.6%,

226

Toxicology 67.5%, and Neuroimaging 71.5% rate of COI disclosures (Appendix 3). The 2010s marked

227

a period of increasing COI disclosures across most medical disciplines (Appendix 4).

228

Funding Disclosure

229

The highest rates of funding disclosure were found in Neuroimaging (94.9%), Materials Science,

230

Biomaterials (94.0%), and Audiology & Speech-language Pathology (93.3%). In contrast, Medical

231

Laboratory Technology reports 60.3%, Andrology 64.7%, and Critical Care Medicine 64.8%

232

(Appendix 3). Funding disclosures, akin to COI disclosures, have shown an overall increase during the

233

2010s across various disciplines (Appendix 4).

234

Protocol Registration

235

Anesthesiology (34.5%) had the highest proportion of articles declaring protocol registration, followed

236

by Rehabilitation (17.2%) and Critical Care Medicine (15.2%). Materials Science, Biomaterials (0.3%),

237

Genetics & Heredity (0.9%), and Virology (1.2%) showed the lowest proportions (Appendix 3).

238

Anesthesiology, for example, has seen a steady increase, reaching up to 40%, contrasting with

239

consistently low rates in disciplines like Immunology and Toxicology (Appendix 4).

240

Data Sharing

241

Data sharing was mentioned most frequently in Genetics & Heredity (37.9%), Neuroimaging (24.7%),

242

and Virology (23.5%), while Surgery, Primary Health Care, and Orthopedics (all 1.6%) showed the

243

lowest rates (Appendix 3). Although there has been an increase in data sharing in certain disciplines,

244

such as Neuroimaging (approximately 80% in 2022), these trends are lower compared to COI and

245

funding disclosures (Appendix 4).

246

Code Sharing

247

In code sharing, Neuroimaging (12.4%), Genetics & Heredity (7.6%), and Medical Informatics (6.3%)

248

had the highest rates of code sharing, in contrast to negligible rates in Orthopedics, Nursing, and

249

Integrative & Complementary Medicine (Appendix 3). Code sharing remains relatively low compared

250

to the higher prevalence of COI and funding disclosures, though an increasing trend is observed in

251

specific medical disciplines (Appendix 4).

252

The random intercept generalized linear mixed-effects logistic models examining transparency

253

indicators over time among different disciplines showed the highest random effects variance for code

254

sharing (1.347) and the lowest for funding disclosure (0.345). Full details are available in Appendix 1

Discussion

258

Our analyses of over two million full-text articles published in SCIE-indexed medical journals revealed

259

high compliance with COI and funding disclosure in medical research since the early 2010s. However,

260

data sharing, protocol registration, and code sharing remained relatively rare. A recent study highlights

261

the critical role of best practices, such as pre-registration, in research (19). It demonstrates that

262

adherence to these practices correlates with an 86% success rate in replication studies, significantly

263

higher than the 50% success rate observed in some earlier replication efforts. Given the observed low

264

rates of protocol registration, code sharing, and data sharing in our analysis, it is plausible that current

265

research in these disciplines may face challenges in replicability, potentially falling short of the higher

266

success rates associated with rigorous adherence to best practices.

267

To our knowledge, differences in transparency practices across a wide range of medical disciplines

268

have not been studied before in this level of detail. Instead of focusing on a single transparency

269

practice, such as data sharing, within one field of medicine or, e.g., its few highest-impact journals, the

270

applied programmatic approach allowed us to estimate five transparency practices across a high

271

number of studies across the range of medical disciplines (15). Previous research on data and code

272

sharing has often taken a more generalized approach, focusing on overarching trends within the

273

biomedical literature or narrowing their scope to specific disciplines or even individual journals (15). In

274

contrast, our study delved into a detailed analysis, revealing substantial disparities, particularly in

275

protocol registration and data or code sharing. These discrepancies likely mirror variations in research

276

methodologies, reporting standards, publishing norms, peer review processes, and editorial practices

277

prevalent across different medical domains. Conversely, our study indicates that COI and funding

278

disclosures have been relatively prevalent since the mid-2000s. This suggests that achieving a high

279

level of adherence to transparency practices could be attainable with concerted and universally applied

280

efforts that have been behind promoting COI and funding disclosures (20). For instance, journals could

281

adhere to Transparency and Openness Promotion Guidelines and guide authors accordingly (21).

282

Recently, it was shown that it is possible to increase data and code sharing with such efforts, and thus

283

subsequently increase the reproducibility of research substantially (22). Indeed, we believe that

284

protocol registration, data and code sharing would become much more common if they were required

285

for publication, similar to current requirements for COI and funding disclosures.

286

Even though we were able to use a large sample of articles and validated methods to estimate the

287

prevalence of five transparency practices, our study also has some limitations. The analyzed articles

288

represent, to some extent, a biased subset of all medical literature, even though earlier research has

289

shown that there are no clear differences in these five transparency practices between articles with and

290

without available full text in the EPMC (23). The applied methodology has not been validated for the

291

whole time, the original validation covered the years 2015-2019 (13). We cannot be sure that it is

292

equally valid/accurate within each of the 59 medical disciplines, because there may be some

293

systematically different ways of registering protocols and sharing data or code, e.g. via some smaller

294

and thus (uncoded) repositories/platforms. Furthermore, we did not manually evaluate the validity or

295

accuracy of the disclosures, protocols, or data/code availability statements, but other studies have found

296

similar results: these are frequently suboptimal (24,25). That is one reason why we are conducting

297

further research to investigate findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability datasets from

298

the articles reporting sharing data (26). In a similar study on COVID-19 research data availability, we

299

found that among 8,015 articles detected by the rtransparent tool as having shared their data in a

300

general repository, 5,700 (71.1%) actually had available data (27). It is also important to note that the

301

articles in our sample included a wide range of research, some of which may not have necessitated

302

using any data or code. Consequently, we acknowledge that achieving a 100% rate in data and code

303

sharing would not be a realistic expectation. For instance, disciplines such as “Medical Ethics” or

304

“Medicine, Legal” may predominantly comprise qualitative research papers, which may not inherently

305

involve creating or utilizing datasets or codes. Instead, in disciplines like “Genetics & Heredity” data-

306

intensive research is likely more common. Additionally, the issue of protocol registration introduces

307

some complexity because there is no consensus regarding the necessity of pre-registration for certain

308

study types, such as explorative (as opposed to hypothesis-testing) or qualitative research. These

309

discrepancies likely drive the observed variations across the 59 distinct medical disciplines.

310

Consequently, it is essential to interpret the results with caution and make comparisons with an

311

understanding of these inherent variations across the diverse spectrum of medical research.

312

Compared to all articles with available full-text in the EPMC database (13), the analyzed subsample of

313

articles from SCIE-indexed medical journals showed higher prevalence of COI and funding disclosures

314

and protocol registration, but equal prevalence data and code-sharing. It seems these disparities

315

primarily stem from historical trends. Specifically, the SCIE-indexed articles exhibited higher levels of

316

transparency practices in earlier years. Interestingly, in 2020, the sample comprising all articles with

317

available full-text in the EPMC database demonstrated greater data and code sharing, but lower

318

adherence to protocol registration, COI disclosures, and funding disclosures when compared to our

319

findings of the SCIE-indexed articles in 2024 (in parenthesis): 15% (11%) for data sharing, 3% (2.5%)

320

for code sharing, 90% (97%) for COI disclosures, 85% (92%) for funding disclosures, and 5% (10%)

321

for protocol registration. Menke et al. have also investigated the presence of protocols and data and

322

code sharing in all articles with full-text in the EPMC database with another automated tool (28). They

323

found a similar constant trend in code sharing that we did. However, they found a more pronounced

324

increase in and higher overall adherence to protocol registration (19% vs. 9%) and data sharing (17%

325

vs. 9%) in 2020 than our findings indicate, potentially attributable to differences in these automated

326

methods.

327

In conclusion, our study reveals that key transparency practices such as data sharing, protocol

328

registration, and especially code sharing continue to be notably scarce in medical research. While

329

adherence to COI and funding disclosures is commendable, the limited adoption of these other crucial

330

transparency practices across diverse medical disciplines remains a significant concern. The recent

331

findings highlighting a high replication success rate with rigorous transparency, underscore the vital

332

need for the universal adoption of such practices (19,22). We urge researchers, journal editors, and

333

policymakers to advance these practices by advocating for the standardization of protocol registration

334

and open data/code sharing across all medical disciplines. Such a collective commitment is essential to

335

enhance the integrity, reliability, and impact of medical research, ultimately benefiting the global health

336

community.
